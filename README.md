Layoffs Data Cleaning Project

Overview

The Layoffs Data Cleaning Project involves cleaning and preparing layoff-related data for analysis. The project includes various MySQL queries to handle tasks like handling missing data, correcting data inconsistencies, and performing normalization of the dataset. This ensures the data is clean and usable for further analysis or reporting.

Objective

The primary objective of this project was to:

1. Clean the layoff dataset using MySQL.

2. Identify and remove any duplicates or inconsistent data entries.

3. Handle missing values and ensure data integrity.

4. Prepare the data for analysis and reporting purposes.


Tools and Technologies Used

MySQL: Used for querying and cleaning the dataset.

SQL Queries: Various SQL techniques (e.g., JOIN, GROUP BY, CASE) were used for data transformation.

Data Cleaning Techniques: Handling NULL values, duplicates, and data normalization.


Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about layoffs, including company names, dates of layoffs, number of employees laid off, and the departments impacted. The data required several cleaning steps to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Steps and Methodology

1. Data Loading

The data was first imported into MySQL using the LOAD DATA INFILE command, after which the dataset was reviewed for any initial anomalies or inconsistencies.

2. Handling Missing Data

Null Values: Identified columns with missing data (NULL values) and decided on strategies for filling or removing them based on the context.

Used IS NULL and IS NOT NULL queries to detect missing values.

Applied COALESCE() and IFNULL() functions to replace NULL values with default values where appropriate.

3. Removing Duplicates

Duplicate rows were identified using DISTINCT and GROUP BY clauses.

Used DELETE to remove duplicate records based on unique identifiers such as company name and layoff date.

4. Data Normalization

Ensured that dates were in a consistent format using the DATE() function and STR_TO_DATE().

Standardized company names and locations by trimming whitespaces and correcting spelling errors.

5. Data Transformation

Converted the number of employees laid off into categories (e.g., small, medium, large layoffs) using CASE statements for easier analysis.

Aggregated the data by company, department, and date to provide insights into layoff trends over time.

6. Data Validation

After cleaning, the data was validated by checking for anomalies, consistency, and outliers. Queries were run to check for any remaining NULL values, duplicates, or inconsistencies.

7. Final Dataset

Once the data was cleaned, it was exported as a CSV file for use in further analysis or reporting.

Challenges Faced

Inconsistent Data Formats: The dataset had inconsistent date formats and missing values in critical columns. This required extensive data transformation and cleaning.

Duplicate Entries: There were several duplicate entries that needed to be identified and removed.


Future Improvements

Automation: Creating stored procedures to automate the data cleaning process for similar datasets in the future.

Advanced Analysis: After the data cleaning, further analysis could be done using advanced SQL queries, including trend analysis and visualization.


Conclusion

This project demonstrates the process of cleaning and transforming a raw dataset to make it ready for analysis. By using various MySQL techniques, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing the data, the dataset was successfully prepared for deeper insights and reporting.

Why Provide Both CSV and SQL Formats?

This project includes the cleaned layoff dataset in two formats: CSV and SQL. Both formats are provided to cater to different use cases and user preferences:

1. CSV Format

Why: CSV files are easy to use and can be opened with tools like Excel, Google Sheets, or any text editor. They are ideal for non-technical users who want to view and analyze the data quickly.

How to Use:
Open the CSV file directly in Excel or Google Sheets to view and analyze the data.

Use Python (e.g., with the pandas library) for advanced data analysis or visualization. Example:

import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('cleaned_data.csv')
print(data.head())

2. SQL Format

Why: The SQL file allows users to directly import the cleaned dataset into a relational database. This is especially useful for developers, analysts, or anyone who wants to query the data dynamically using SQL.

How to Use:

Import the SQL file into a MySQL database using the following steps:

1. Open your MySQL Workbench or Command Line interface.

2. Use the command:
SOURCE /path/to/cleaned_data.sql;

3. This will recreate the table with the cleaned data in your database.


Detailed Instructions for Each Format

Importing the SQL File into a Database

1. Open MySQL Workbench and connect to your database.

2. Go to File > Open SQL Script, and select the cleaned_data.sql file.

3. Execute the script by clicking the Run button (lightning icon).

4. The table will be created with all the cleaned data in your database.

5. Use SQL queries to further analyze or manipulate the data.


Using the CSV File
In Excel:

1. Open Excel and go to File > Open.

2. Select the cleaned_data.csv file.

3. Follow the import wizard if necessary to ensure the columns are properly aligned.

4. Analyze the data using Excel tools like pivot tables, charts, or filters.


In Python:

1. Install the pandas library if you haven’t already:

pip install pandas

2. Load the CSV file using pandas:

import pandas as pd
data = pd.read_csv('cleaned_data.csv')
print(data.info())

3. Perform analysis or create visualizations as needed.


By providing both formats, this project ensures flexibility and accessibility for a wider range of users, whether they prefer working in databases, spreadsheets, or programming environments.



## Layoffs EDA SQL Queries

This folder contains SQL queries used for the Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of the layoffs data. These queries were executed in MySQL Workbench to explore and clean the dataset.

The `Layoffs_EDA_queries.sql` file includes:
- Data filtering and transformation queries.
- Aggregation and summarization of key metrics.
- Data exploration steps for understanding trends and patterns.

These SQL queries were used to gain insights from the layoffs data and form the basis for further analysis within the project.
